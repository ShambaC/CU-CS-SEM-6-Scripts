# CU-CS-SEM-6-Scripts
Random scripts for Computational Intelligence

# I AM BACC

## What is this ?
This time around, there's no practical in the core courses. Instead we had to do project.

Look at my project here ðŸ‘‰ [LINK IN CAPS](https://github.com/ShambaC/Handwritten-Text-Recognition).

So, let's come back to the question in hand. If, we didn't have any practical in core courses, then what the hell is this ? The answer is, there exist papers called Discipline Specific Elective Course. This paper has choices. I did computational intelligence. The other choice was Advanced Java. Who does that ? I am not gonna make minecraft. Therefore, this repo includes scripts for CI. So, only prolog files. As of writing this README, I haven't uploaded any files, So, I don't know if github will detect prolog files as susch or will it think of them as perl files Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯.

## Why ?
For reference. To be used by me and my friends, hence public.

## What are the programs in it ?
File names should indicate that. If it doesn't find out yourself by reading the file.

### Do you know me ?
If not then how the hell did you even get here ? ~PLEASE IGNORE THE REPO. THANK YOU.~
